I added a page where the user can see and change the content of the post and if they’re satisfied, they can just save the updated content. Although it needs to be refreshed to see the updated content as I have to implement react redux to set a global state management and dynamically update the post’s content on save. I have tried to implement it but I don’t have enough time to learn and implement it so I decided to leave it at just that for now.',

I have also done a general improved in the UI, adjusting the padding and positioning of various element in different pages ensuring a seamless design and user experience. I also took the time of cleaning my workspace, deleting unnecessary files, signing out the accounts that I have used and removing saved passwords on the browser so that the unit that I have used will be ready for the next user.
